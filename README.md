# Data Size Analyses

This is the repository for the ACL Findings '22 paper [On the Importance of Data Size in Probing Fine-tuned Models](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.20/).

# Getting Started

1. Fine-tune and save your model

    We have provided some checkpoints of our fine-tuned models which can be downloaded from [here](). To use your models make sure you change the following line in `SentEval_Probing_notebook.ipynb` to the path where your model is saved:
    
        SAVED_MODELS_DIR = "PATH TO YOUR MODEL"

2. Run `SentEval_Probing_notebook.ipynb` to probe your model on SentEval tasks.
